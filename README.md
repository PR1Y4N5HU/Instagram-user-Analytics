This project revolves around a MySQL database that stores information about users, their profiles, and their activities. The objective of this project is to extract valuable insights and analyze the data to gain a deeper understanding of the user base. By employing various SQL queries, including join operations, counting functions, and grouping techniques, we can uncover interesting patterns, statistics, and trends within the data.
Throughout this project, we will utilize SQL queries such as JOIN, COUNT, and GROUP BY to extract the desired insights. By combining these queries with appropriate filtering and sorting techniques, we can effectively analyze the database, gain valuable knowledge, and make informed decisions based on the findings.
